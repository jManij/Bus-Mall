User Stories 
Project: Bus-Mall


•	As a developer, I want to ensure that I have logged all the important features of the program. For example: checking in the newly created 'Pictures' objects that take default values.
•	As a developer, I want to have good wireframe built for the project. This is going to be an important guiding document that get updated with new requirements.
•	As a developer, I want to display 3 images randomly selected from the images directory and wait for the user's click. Once, maximum number of clicks are obtained, I want to let users know. 
•	As a developer, I will have a strong consideration to users' experience. This means to ensure the UI has all the features that help with the experience. This also involves a significant time allocatoin on design aspects.
•	As a developer, I want to include charts and appealing visual appearances to tally clicks counted from the user activity.
•	As a developer, I want to randomize the images without any biases. This being said, they all will have equal possiblity of occurences. Additionally, it will also check to see if the next images are direct desendents of the previous occurences.
•	As a developer, I want to make sure that the data generated from users are persisted through storage.
